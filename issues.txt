Issue 1. Consider defining a bean of type 'org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.JwtDecoder' in your configuration.
Soulution::
Add this missing property in bootstrap.properties
==> spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/microservices-realm


Issue 2
The bean 'tokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory', defined in class path resource [org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/gateway/TokenRelayAutoConfiguration.class], could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in class path resource 
[org/springframework/cloud/gateway/config/GatewayAutoConfiguration$TokenRelayConfiguration.class] and overriding is disabled.
Solution::
Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting 
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true

Issue 3
Login Page issue in Postman 
Solution:: (This change is needed when you want to hit the apis from Postman Authorization feature)
Change ApiGateway service as OAuth2 resource server instead of OAuth2 Client (see Part 2 revised Video)
